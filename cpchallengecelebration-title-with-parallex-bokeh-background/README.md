# CPChallenge - Celebration Title with Parallex Bokeh Background 

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/tommyho/pen/xbKONKm](https://codepen.io/tommyho/pen/xbKONKm).

This CodePen script features a festive title displayed on a dynamic parallax bokeh background. The background is filled with colorful, softly glowing bokeh circles that gently animate to simulate depth and motion. As the user moves their cursor or scrolls, the parallax effect shifts the bokeh elements, creating an engaging 3D illusion. Clicking the screen will change the colors. It combines CSS and JavaScript to manage animations and responsiveness, ensuring a visually stunning and immersive experience.

Feel feel to change the title. Let me know if youâ€™d like help creating or tweaking this script!
